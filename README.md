# 1millionBot Chat Challenge

## Introduction

At 1millionbot we care a lot about the service and image we provide to our clients. The first contact that our users have with us is our chat window where they can interact with our chatbots. This chat is where the âœ¨*magic*âœ¨ of 1millionbot happens and that's why it's so important to us.

## Description

Your task is simple, you have to **create a chat window** for our chatbots. You can use [our chat window](./examples/chat-screenshot.jpg) as a guide but feel free to design it as you like.
To accomplish it you must follow the following points:

- You can use vanilla JS or any framework, bonus points if it is [Angular](https://angular.io/).
- The messages from the chatbot must be different from the user ones, positioning them right and left its the easiest way to fullfill this one ðŸ˜‰
